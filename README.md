Zizifn Edge tunnel is a proxy tool based on Cloudflare workers and Pages, supporting multiple protocols and configuration options.



## Cloudflare pages

### Environment Variables
variables required for Constructing pages.dev 

| variables | Examples | Values |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |  
| UUID | `206b7ab3-2b7b-4784-9839-c617c7f73ce4` | To generate your own UUID refer to<br> [![UUID](https://img.shields.io/badge/ID_generator-gray?logo=lucid)](https://www.uuidgenerator.net) |
| ProxyIP | `nima.nscl.ir` <br>`turk.radicalization.ir` | To find proxyIP<br> [![ProxyIP](https://img.shields.io/badge/Check_here-gray?logo=envoyproxy)](https://github.com/NiREvil/vless/blob/main/sub/ProxyIP.md) |


## Cloudflare workers

If you intend to create a worker, you can proceed similarly to the page and utilize the same variables;

however, it is also possible to modify them directly within the code.  
To do this, you need to replace your "UUID" [^1] value in line `SEVEN` of "worker-vless.js file" [^2] ,
and the ProxyIP can be adjusted from line `NINE`.  

You can find some "proxyIPs" [^3] from this great repository, and there is even a guide on how to find new proxies included in the repo.
